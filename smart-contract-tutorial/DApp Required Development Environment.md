<h1 align="center">DApp Required Development Environment</h1>

## DApp development 

Developers can choose any programming language and tools to develop a dApp. And they can also integrate Ontology's SDK to accelerate the development.

Ontology official provides:

- [Java SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-java-sdk)
- [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-ts-sdk)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-go-sdk)

[Ontology Community](https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers) also provides SDKs of other programming languages.

## Node

### Ontology testing network

Developers can use Ontology's testing  network to develop. The testing network IP addresses are as follows:

````
http://polaris1.ont.io
http://polaris2.ont.io
http://polaris3.ont.io
http://polaris4.ont.io
......
````

Besides, the test network provides the following ports:

````
20334 // for restful
20335 // for websocket
20336 // for rpc
````

### Local node

Developers can deploy local nodes if needed.

For detailed deployment procedures, please refer to [Ontology document](https://github.com/ontio/ontology)。

## Smart contract

Developers can choose different programming languages ​​to write smart contracts such as C # and Python. Using a good IDE can bring great convenience to the coding process. The tools for developing NEO smart contracts are also suitable for developing Ontology smart contracts because Ontology and NEO use the same smart contract system.

Ontology provides an online smart contract development tool [SmartX] (http://smartx.ont.io/#/) to help developers write, deploy and invoke smart contracts.  In the future, it will provide more extensive features.
