<h1 align="center">What is DApp?</h1>

DApp is an abbreviated form for decentralized application. A DApp consists of back-end code that runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. A DApp can also have a user interface, created by front-end code that makes calls to the back-end. DApp do not require a central authority to function: they allow for direct interaction between users and providers.

There are common features of Dapps:

*   **Open Source**. Ideally, it should be governed by autonomy and all changes must be decided by the consensus, or a majority, of its users. Its code base should be available for scrutiny.

*   **Decentralized**. All records of the application’s operation must be stored on a public and decentralized blockchain to avoid pitfalls of centralization.

*   **Incentivized**. Validators of the blockchain should be incentivized by rewarding them accordingly with cryptographic tokens.

*   **Protocol.** The application community must agree on a cryptographic algorithm to show proof of value. For example, Bitcoin uses [Proof of Work (PoW)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work) and Ethereum is currently using PoW with plans for a [hybrid PoW/Proof of Stake (PoS)](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ)[5](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/dapps/#sdfootnote5sym) in the future.
